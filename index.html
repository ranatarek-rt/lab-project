<h1><u>Racism</u></h1>
<p style="font-size:50px;"><b><i>what is racism?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Racism</b>, also called racialism, the belief that humans may be divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called <q><b>races</b></q>, racism takes many forms and can happen in many places. It includes prejudice, discrimination or hatred directed at someone because of their colour, ethnicity or national origin.</p>
<p>People often associate racism with acts of abuse or harassment. However, it doesnâ€™t need to involve violent or intimidating behaviour. Take racial name-calling and jokes. Or consider situations when people may be excluded from groups or activities because of where they come from.</p>
<p><b>Racism</b> can be most simply understood as someone behaving differently to another person based on the colour of their skin or culture, people who look different or speak a different language and  people wear certain styles of clothing because of their religion and may get bullied because of this</b></q></p>
<p><q><b>Racism is more than just words, beliefs and actions. It includes all the barriers that prevent people from enjoying dignity and equality because of their race.</p>
